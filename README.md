# GiphySearch

GiphySearch is a simple, client-side jQuery-based webapp that has an existing set of buttons (based on a pre-built array) that make requests to the GIPHY API. There is also an input field for the user to create their own buttons and make their own searches to the GIPHY API.

## Usage

1. Access this project [here](https://happyliltrees.github.io/GiphySearch/)
2. Try the existing searches, or add your own via the input!

## Future Plans

1. center-align the content
2. add styling to the DIVs
3. add a ‘clear’ button for the user
